                    I got into gardening inspired by my early experiences foraging for wild edibles and
                    my garden still shows many signs of this influence.  While certain crops are planted in neat rows 
                    and managed carefully, many other species are naturalized here and are allowed to grow wherever they 
                    volunteer. Because of this approach, a walk around the garden always has a surprize in store!
                    The garden produces lots to eat, but productivity is never the top priority. My focus is always 
                    on improving soil health, creating wildlife habitat, and increasing bio-diversity.

                    The sides of the garden that face the street are lined with a thick wall of banana "trees", which technically are a type of grass.
                    They have no woody parts, are extremely watery, and even the widest of stalks can be chopped with a single machete stroke.
                    Each stalk will bear fruit only once and then rot, but the root cluster survives and is constantly sending up new stalks to replace those that reach maturity.
                    Each day one of the bright red leaves of the "bell" opens to reveal a row of flowers that will turn into a "hand" of bananas.

                    I didn't come to enjoy eating papaya until I grew them myself. Most papaya sold at grocery stores never ripen properly because they are picked prematurely to
                    improve shelflife. I usually leave the fruits on the trees until one or two days before they are ready to eat and this way they get much sweeter and more 
                    interesting flavor. Papaya is a key ingredient in my homegrown fruit smoothies. I sell papaya green, ripe, or frozen.

                    I started growing a lot of turmeric when I decided that I wanted the STEM Garden to require less maintenance while still producing valuable crops. 
                    Turmeric is very happy in New Orleans' climate, especially in our soft airy soil. Its broad leaves help shade out weeds and other competition. 
                    Unlike all the fruits we grow, which need picked regularly when they are in season, turmeric only requires hands on work a few days out of the year.
                    It keeps very well if it is dug up in the dry season, so each October I dig up all the turmeric, break the big root clusters into little pieces and replant 
                    some portion of them the same day. The roots that are kept sell for up to $20 per pound, whereas banana and papaya sell for less than $2 per pound.

                    Besides banana, papaya, and turmeric there are dozens of other plants that are grown here for thier beauty, for personal consumption, and for sharing 
                    with friends and neighbors. One of the things that got me into gardening was the realization that food is better when the distance between the plant 
                    and the kitchen is minimized. Not only are homegrown tomatoes free, they are immesurably better than any tomato that has been shipped in from another 
                    state and made to wait around on a grocery store shelf. While I don't grow all my own food, I do eat something I grew everyday. Meal preparation always 
                    starts with a walk around the garden to see what needs to get used.

                    I prefer to grow food and don't put a lot of energy into growing plants that are only ornamental, but there are many food bearing plants that also have  
                    beautiful flowers. Some plants I grow primarily for their flowers as a way to attract pollinators.

                    The STEM Garden is home to frogs, toads, and lizards that help me by eating the bugs that would have eaten my plants. I have even seen speckled
                    kingsnakes and herons. The presence of top predators like these is a great sign that there is good balance on the lower rungs of the food chain. When the
                    garden was first getting started there were a lot of rats but as this urban micro-ecosystem has matured there have been fewer rats and more squirrels and opossum.
                    I don't do anything to encourage this wildlife to be here beside create a safe habitat.

                    Established in 2016, the STEM Garden started as a blighted lot in the St.Claude neighborhood of New Orleans that was so overgrown and covered in trash that I was 
                    able to buy it at auction for less than the price of one year's rent. When I first started cleaning up the land I was living in my van. I built a toolshed the first 
                    year, and after that two tiny houses on trailers which are known as the "Tearoom" and the "Classroom". In order to remediate pollutants in the topsoil I brought in 
                    and composted 350 cubic yards of horse manure, grass clippings, and leaves. That's enough to cover the entire property in an 18-inch thick layer of organic matter 
                    before it all decomposed!
