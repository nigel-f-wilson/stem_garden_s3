                    To be a good teacher one must remain in touch with what it feels like to be a student. <br />
                    In Eastern philosophy this is often refered to as retaining a "beginner's mind". <br />
                    To be a student is to ask questions and to pursue answers. It is to confront the unknown. 
                    To be a teacher is to be a role model for students. A good teacher models excitement at learning
                    new things and is never preoccupied with keeping up the appearance of being an expert.
                    A teacher must never be afraid to say, "I don't know the answer to your question but I bet we 
                    can find it together." A teacher is dedicated to being a life-long learner and realizes that all 
                    learning starts with realizing that there is something you have yet to learn.

                "I wouldnâ€™t have made it through my first semester of grad school without Nigel. I had tried a few different tutors before 
                Nigel but he is the perfect tutor. He takes a mathematical concept and makes it understandble and relevant. 
                He listened to me complain about my professor, and then redirected to keep me positive and on track. He helped 
                me to to master the steps and to understand the concepts well enough that I could explain things to the people 
                in my study group. I wish he could always be my math teacher! -J. Richelson

                "I highly recommend Nigel without reservation for tutoring in mathematics because of his ability to convey the subject 
                matter clearly while still presenting it in an interesting way with real world examples.  He taught my son 7th grade 
                mathematics while employed at Waldorf School in New Orleans and it was clear that he brought much preparation and care 
                to his teaching while encouraging his students' solving ability and thirst for knowledge with an upbeat attitude." -W. Mains
                
                "I worked with Nigel and witnessed his enthusiasm for teaching math. He developed the math curriculum for and taught 4th-8th grade. 
                Our students were very engaged in math while he was our math teacher. For the first time in a long time, 
                they were excited to go to math because his lessons were so interesting and thought provoking. 
                I hope Nigel can come back to our school as a chess teacher as soon as the restrictions on after 
                school activities are lifted. J. CONTENTO, Faculty Chair WSNO

                and have tutored students through undergrad and graduate level courses in physics, statistics, and calculus.
                I am well versed in the Common Core Math Standards and have completed training in Waldorf teaching methodology.
                I strive to identify and fill knowledge gaps trough direct instruction when necessary,

                In school settings, math is often presented as a list of vocabulary to memorize
                and computational skills that kids must master in order to move onto the next level.
                This approach induces anxiety and crushes kids' natural curiosity and will to learn. 
                Students crave relevance. The ask for the "real world applications" of the math they are required to learn.
                This makes perfect sense considering human beings retain new information by connecting it to 
                past experiences. We don't retain information because we are told we will need it someday; 
                we retain information best when we have sought it out in the process of solving a problem we 
                already cared about finding a solution to.

                    I offer private and small group chess lessons and facilitate afterschool clubs in partnership with local schools. <br />
                    Group lessons are a great option for siblings or for parents who aren't experienced players themselves
                    but have a child who is interested in the game and needs a practice partner.

                    Chess and Math both require us to plan ahead, to be creative, and disiplined, and thorough in our thinking. <br />
                    As a math teacher, I am frequently asked by students struggling with motivation,
                    "Why do I have to learn this? When am I going to need this?"
                    As a chess teacher I am never asked anything of the sort.
                    Chess is an abstract game. It has no practical applications and noone is required to learn it,
                    and yet, something about it draws kids to apply themselves. Chess makes kids <em>want</em> to think hard
                    and it helps them come to see that learning and having fun are two things that can go together.
                    Getting my students to <em>think out loud</em> enables me to tailor my guidance, to make it most
                    relvant to them. For many kids who struggle with this in the context of math tutoring, chess has an
                    almost magical ability to draw them out of their shells and to get them to verbalize their thoughts,
                    making them more effective students all around. <br />
