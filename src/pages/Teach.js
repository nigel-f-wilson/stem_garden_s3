                My Math Teaching Experience
            </Typography>
            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimargutterBottom y' component='p' variant='body1'>
                I earned my degree in math education from Ohio University in 2015. While working toward my degree I completed several internships in
                rural and inner city public schools in Ohio. For my final semester-long teaching internship I lived in New Delhi, India and taught at
                Step-By-Step School.  In 2016, I moved from Ohio to New Orleans to launch my teaching career at Einstein Middle School.
                Within a few months of moving I purchassed a blighted vacant lot and began the long process of cleaning it up and
                transforming it into the STEM Garden. Throughout the next two years I spent my mornings developing the garden and taught math and physics
                at College Track, an afterschool program for aspiring first generation college students.
                After College Track, I took a break from classroom-based teaching. Students are full of questions about the "real-world" uses for the math
                they are taught in school so it serves a math teacher well to have some personal experience using math in the "real-world".
                I worked as farm manager for Recirculating Farms Coaltion and got to learn a lot about aquaponics and the math required to run
                the business side of a small farm. I also worked as an electrician's assistant with Ziemba Electric and Atlas Electric.
                I already had some text-book understanding of electrical circuits, but through this experience I learned how to go from theory
                all the way through to craftsmanlike installations.
                During the 2019-2020 school year I was back in the classroom, working as the math specialist at the Waldorf School of New Orleans.
                I designed curriculum and taught math to students in grades 4-8. I taught through the transition to remote learning, but at the end
                of the year the school had to downsize. Throughout the previous four years I had taken occasional gigs as a free lance in-home math tutor but
                the pandemic pushed me to take that business online and it has been growing steadily since.

                By Enrichment I mean "All the math they don't teach you in school." I am a jack-of-all-trades and I have applied math to 
                improve my own life in countless ways, including in building the classroom that I teach out of and the solar array that powers it. 
                My approach to math enrichment focuses on learning math along the way to reaching another goal you care about, rather than learning math on
                the promise that someday down the road you'll find it useful. Enrichment can go any direction you want it to! What do you want to build?
                Here are some favorite trailheads I've used before for enrichment explorations, just to jog your imagination:<br /> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Explore the physics of sound waves and the mathematical pattern in the way the frets are spaced on the neck of a guitar.</li>
                    <li>Build things! Learn how to design and build stable wooden structures. Work your way up to building a catault and learn geometry and calculus along the way.</li>
                    <li>Master strategy games like Nim, Hex, the 15-Game, and logic puzzles like sudoku and ken-ken. </li>
                    <li>Learn about the off-grid solar power system that supplies the classroom.</li>

                Why Learn Chess?

            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                Learning chess helps kids experience firsthand that thinking hard and having fun can go together. <br />
                Math and Chess have a lot in common. They both require creative, yet disiplined, thinking. 
                Math is very useful, and so kids are required to learn it in school. Unfortunately, that pressure to learn 
                math often causes them to lose sight of the fact that doing math can be really fun. When students feel under pressure 
                in math classes they start asking "Why do I <em>have to</em> learn this?" and "When am I going to <em>need</em> this?" <br /><br />

                By contrast, Chess is an abstract game with no practical applications.  No one is required to learn it,
                and yet, something about it makes kids feel drawn to apply their full reasoning abilities.
                No one has ever inturrupted a chess lesson to ask me "When am I going to <em>need</em> this?"
                Chess makes kids <em>want</em> to think hard.  It is an excellent medium for teaching kids to 
                think out loud and to think through questioning, both skills which carry over and make them more effective 
                learners in all other subjects. including math. Players also develop greater self-awareness about how their 
                emotions affect their thinking process

            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                I have played chess for 18 years and I am currently rated ~1600, or in the 90th percentile of players on chess.com.
                I'm a long way from the title of 'Master' but I have a knack for explaining the game. At the club I went to as a kid 
                I was encouraged to play 'teaching games' with other kids as soon as I had something to teach, so I've been teaching 
                chess even longer than I've been teaching math! <br /> Besides establishing chess clubs at College Track and the 
                Waldorf School I have taught chess summer camps offered by Strategic Thoughts in partnership with NORD.

                Chess & Test Prep

            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                I got serious about running youth chess clubs while working at College Track. CT placed a strong emphasis on preping kids for
                fast-paced high-stakes standardized tests. I reflected on my own experience getting a scholarship based on my ACT score and I
                realized that, though the math topics covered on the ACT had been gone over in school, what had really prepared me for the test's
                pressure level and pace was all the speed chess I had played as a kid. It was chess that taught me to cope with time pressure, 
                to focus my mind so that I could think clearly in a stressful circumstance. I offer discounted rates on SAT and ACT prep for 
                students who add on chess lessons.

            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                Preparing for high-stakes standardized tests takes more than just learning the math concepts covered on them.
                You must also be prepared to apply those concepts to solve unfamiliar types of problems. This requires 
                creative thinking, something that most people struggle with when under time pressure.
                I take a wholistic approach to preparing students for these exams. I don't just review the math concepts, I help 
                students overcome test taking anxiety, learn to mannage their time effectively, and to recognize shortcuts when they
                are possible.

                High-stakes standardized tests are an unfortunate and unavoidable part of the modern education landscape.
                They are neither a fair nor a complete means of assessing students' academic abilities.
                They are obsolete and reward qualities that are no longer as valuable to society as Sugata Mitra explains in his
                2012 TED Talk&reg; <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud?language=en">"Build a School in the Cloud"</a> 
                Nonetheless, they are here to stay, and doing well on them can unlock doors. The ACT score I got when I 
                was a junior in highschool was the key to me earning a full-tuition scholarship to Ohio University, and 
                ultimately graduating without crushing student loan debt.  I joke that taking the ACT took me about four hours and earned 
                me a $40,000 scholarship, making it by far the best hourly rate I have ever earned in my working life.

                        To be a good teacher one must remain in touch with what it feels like to be a student. <br />
                        In Eastern philosophy this is often refered to as retaining a "beginner's mind". <br />
                        To be a student is to ask questions and to pursue answers. It is to confront the unknown.
                        To be a teacher is to be a role model for students. A good teacher models excitement at learning
                        new things and is never preoccupied with keeping up the appearance of being an expert.
                        A teacher must never be afraid to say, "I don't know the answer to your question but I bet we
                        can find it together." A teacher is dedicated to being a life-long learner and realizes that all
                        learning starts with realizing that there is something you have yet to learn.
