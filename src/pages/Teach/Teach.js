                        To be a good teacher one must remain in touch with what it feels like to be a student. <br />
                        In Eastern philosophy this is often refered to as retaining a "beginner's mind". <br />
                        To be a student is to ask questions and to pursue answers. It is to confront the unknown.
                        To be a teacher is to be a role model for students. A good teacher models excitement at learning
                        new things and is never preoccupied with keeping up the appearance of being an expert.
                        A teacher must never be afraid to say, "I don't know the answer to your question but I bet we
                        can find it together." A teacher is dedicated to being a life-long learner and realizes that all
                        learning starts with realizing that there is something you have yet to learn.

                    High-stakes standardized tests are an unfortunate and unavoidable part of the modern education landscape.                
                    They are neither a fair nor a complete means of assessing students' academic abilities.
                    They reward qualities that are no longer valuable as Sugata Mitra explains early in his

                    Nonetheless, they are here to stay, and doing well on them can unlock doors. The ACT score I got when I 
                    was a junior in highschool was the key to me earning a four-year full tuition scholarship to Ohio University. 
                    I joke that, at about $10,000 dollars per hour, taking the ACT that morning was the best hourly rate I have ever earned in my working life.

                    Why Learn Chess?
                </Typography>
                <Typography align='left' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                    Learning chess helps kids experience firsthand that thinking hard and having fun can go together. <br />
                    Math and Chess have a lot in common. They both require us to plan ahead, to think creatively,
                    yet to be disiplined and thorough at the same time. <br /><br />

                    Math is very useful, and it is very fun. Some well-meaning but misguided folks made it a law that every
                    child in the U.S. ought to be required to study math, because it is so useful. This law backfired though,
                    and caused many kids to lose sight of the fact that math is fun.  When you take the fun out and put the pressure on
                    students start to struggle to feel motivated in math class it is common for them to push back and ask,
                    "Why do I <em>have to</em> learn this? When am I going to <em>need</em> this?" <br /><br />

                    By contrast, Chess is an abstract game with no practical applications.  Noone is required to learn it,
                    yet, something about it makes kids feel drawn to apply their full rational abilities.
                    Chess makes kids <em>want</em> to think hard.  <br /><br />

                    Getting my students to <em>think out loud</em> enables me to tailor the guidance I offer to make it most
                    relvant to them. For many kids who struggle with this in the context of math tutoring, chess has an
                    almost magical ability to draw them out of their shells and to get them to verbalize their thoughts,
                    making them more effective students all around. <br /><br />

                    Getting good at chess requires more than just studying board positions.
                    You must also develop your self-awareness and adopt certain habits of mind.
                    Even if chess itself has no practical applications, the thought-habits that
                    you develop over the board will make you a more effective thinker and will
                    be valuable habits to possess in whatever you do.

                transforming it into the STEM Garden. Throughout the next two years I spent my mornings developing the garden and taught math and physics
                at College Track, an afterschool program for aspiring first generation college students.
                After College Track, I took a break from classroom-based teaching. Students are full of questions about the "real-world" uses for the math
                they are taught in school so it serves a math teacher well to have some personal experience using math in the "real-world".
                I worked as farm manager for Recirculating Farms Coaltion and got to learn a lot about aquaponics and the math required to run
                the business side of a small farm. I also worked as an electrician's assistant with Ziemba Electric and Atlas Electric.
                I already had some text-book understanding of electrical circuits, but through this experience I learned how to go from theory
                all the way through to craftsmanlike installations.
                During the 2019-2020 school year I was back in the classroom, working as the math specialist at the Waldorf School of New Orleans.
                I designed curriculum and taught math to students in grades 4-8. I taught through the transition to remote learning, but at the end
                of the year the school had to downsize. Throughout the previous four years I had taken occasional gigs as a free lance in-home math tutor but
                the pandemic pushed me to take that business online and it has been growing steadily since.

                By Enrichment I mean "All the math they don't teach you in school." Enrichment can go any direction you want it to.  
                I have some favorite trailheads I've used before:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Explore the physics of sound waves and the mathematical pattern in the way the frets are spaced on the neck of a guitar.</li>
                    <li>Build things! Learn how to design and build stable wooden structures. Work your way up to building a catault and learn geometry and calculus along the way.</li>
                    <li>Master strategy games like Nim, Hex, the 15-Game, and logic puzzles like sudoku and ken-ken. </li>
                    {/* <li>Make Coppernicus Challenge jig. </li> */}
                    <li>Learn about the off-grid solar power system that supplies the classroom.</li>
                </ul>
                But the point is to find a topic that you're really curious about and to dive into learning all you can about it 
                picking up as much relevant math along the way as you can. Learning math in the context of learning something else you 
                are because you need it to understand something elsething you really want to understand
                Learn how to apply math to excell at games of chance and pure strategy. 
                Build something! Catapults are a lot of fun and a great introduction to calculus.

                In school settings, math is often presented as a list of vocabulary to memorize
                and computational skills that kids must master in order to move onto the next level.
                This approach induces anxiety and crushes kids' natural curiosity and will to learn. 
                Students crave relevance. The ask for the "real world applications" of the math they are required to learn.
                This makes perfect sense considering human beings retain new information by connecting it to 
                past experiences. We don't retain information because we are told we will need it someday; 
                we retain information best when we have sought it out in the process of solving a problem we 
                already cared about finding a solution to.

                Why Learn Chess?
            </Typography>
            <Typography align='left' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                Learning chess helps kids experience firsthand that thinking hard and having fun can go together. <br />
                Math and Chess have a lot in common. They both require us to think creatively
                yet to be disiplined and thorough at the same time. <br /><br />

                Math is very useful, and so there has come to be a lot of pressure on kids to do well in math class. And this
                pressure makes it hard to remember that doing math can be fun. Students don't generally ask the questions "Why do I <em>have to</em> learn this? 
                When am I going to <em>need</em> this?" until they are feeling pressured. <br /><br />

                By contrast, Chess is an abstract game with no practical applications.  No one is required to learn it,
                yet, something about it makes kids feel drawn to apply their full rational abilities.
                Chess makes kids <em>want</em> to think hard.  <br /><br />

                Getting my students to <em>think out loud</em> enables me to tailor the guidance I offer to make it most
                relvant to them. For many kids who struggle with this in the context of math tutoring, chess has an
                almost magical ability to draw them out of their shells and to get them to verbalize their thoughts,
                making them more effective students all around. <br /><br />

                Getting good at chess requires more than just studying board positions.
                You must also develop your self-awareness and adopt certain habits of mind.
                Even if chess itself has no practical applications, the thought-habits that
                you develop over the board will make you a more effective thinker and will
                be valuable habits to possess in whatever you pursue.
